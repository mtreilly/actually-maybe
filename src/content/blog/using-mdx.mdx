import Sidenote from '../../components/Sidenote.astro';

This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. MDX stands for Markdown + JSX, allowing you to embed React components directly in markdown. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. JSX is JavaScript XML syntax, allowing you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze. Astro is a modern static site generator that supports multiple frameworks and file types.

MDX also lets you sprinkle inline context without derailing the narrative.

<Sidenote>
	Use sidenotes to add references, citations, or behind-the-scenes commentary while keeping the main flow focused.
</Sidenote>

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="#" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>
