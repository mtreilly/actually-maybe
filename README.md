```

> 🧑‍🚀 **Seasoned astronaut?** Delete this file. Have fun!

Features:

- ✅ Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- ✅ 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- ✅ SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- ✅ Sitemap support
- ✅ RSS Feed support
- ✅ Markdown & MDX support
- ✅ Site-wide LLM-ready markdown export (`/path.md`, `/topics/ai.md`, `/about.md`, etc.)
- ✅ In-page “LLM ready” menu with ChatGPT/Claude launchers + Cmd+Shift+M shortcut

Reference: `/.well-known` style hints live at `/llm.txt` for crawler discovery.

## 🤖 LLM-ready documentation

Every page now has a dedicated `.md` endpoint plus a lightweight “LLM ready” dropdown in the article header.

- Append `.md` to any route (`/blog/my-post.md`, `/topics/astro.md`, `/projects.md`, `/index.md`) to fetch clean markdown with canonical metadata and helpful frontmatter.
- Use the dropdown buttons to copy the rendered markdown, grab a shareable `.md` link, or launch ChatGPT/Claude with the markdown preloaded. You can also trigger the action from the command palette (Cmd+K) or the global shortcut (Cmd+Shift+M).
- Responses are cached (`max-age=86400, immutable`), sent with `text/markdown`, and discoverable via `/llm.txt` for tooling that wants to auto-detect the capability.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
